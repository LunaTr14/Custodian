# Custodian
Hardcore Minecraft plugin that deletes all worlds on player death

Java Version 21 and meant for Minecraft 1.20+

<br>This plugin is meant to be used with a server host that has an "auto reboot on crash" like setting, since this shuts down the server with the worlds deleted, and the startup will create the new worlds
